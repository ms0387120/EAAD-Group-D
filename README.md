  - links relatively new papers (2016-2018) for emotion detection
  - important in all levels of automation
    - Mauel driving: 
      - semi-autonomous driving: adjust timing of takeover depending on emotions
      - counteracts for frustration and agression: speech-based systems, play music or massagingfunction in the seat (emotion is detected)
      - Important for safety
    - Autonomous driving: 
      - confused (HMI design) or scared (driving style) driver
      - counteracts for frustration and agression: apply cognitive emotion regulation strategies, suggest relaxing movies/ music, display messages from friends, adapt smoother driving (emotion is detected)
      - Important for user acceptance

## Discussion Notes

* 0423 Meeting

  - What **"Safety"** means ?
    
    - Teacher Answer
    - **Focus on in-cabin** environment. From the safety perspective there is no distinction between driver and passengers in in-cabin environment.
    - Consider two main directions of "full autonomy" and "partial autonomy" as the main story line of your research and try to define your research questions accordingly. In that case, you can properly distribute the applications by their target group (either on "driver-only" or "driver+passenger").
    - **Cover both directions (Driver + passengers) to discuss**
    - Your applications can be related to either comfort domain or driving dynamics, which the latter has the highest impact on safety. 

  - Read more literatures **at least ten**
  - need to complete comparison table

* 0430 Meeting

  - Follow this direction
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66301041/116667380-6639fa00-a99c-11eb-92ba-6233556618c9.png) 
  - Julia：Focus on **Camera** & **Biosensors**
  - Mei-Ju: Focus on **Microphones** & **CAN-Bus Steering Wheel Seat**
  - Next discussion, we need to organize the outline of the presentation 

* Fist Presentation/ Paper Structure Draft Julia:
	1. Intro: 
		- Importance of Emotional Awareness in all stages of automation (Manuel vs. Semi-automated vs. Fully Autonomous)
			- Differentiatle importance / impact / safety concerns
	2. Main Part: How to detect emotional awareness (Sensoring)
	3. What to do with the result of detected emotion? (Interpretation, Reaction of System on emotion)
		- Optional: close the cycle by adopting to the levels of automation (if not always mentioned besides)
