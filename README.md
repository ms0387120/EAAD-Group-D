* [Automatic Emotion Recognition for the Calibration of Autonomous Driving Functions](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/9/3/518)

    - Motivation: social acceptance
    - Safety: Passengers' experience (increase human trust to AI)
    - Goals: classify the people’s reaction to vehicle decisions and obtain an objective metric about the comfort feeling of the passengers
    - How: analyze the passengers’ emotions while driving with alternative vehicle calibrations
    - Methods: Use Another 2 Papers to ensemble them
    - Result: deploy either into real vehicles or simulators, during the driving functions calibration

* [Emotion recognition for semi-autonomous vehicles framework](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12008-018-0473-9)

    - Motivation: how human brain works to express emotion
    - Safety: Driver Emotion Detection (Assistence)
    - Goals: by multiple kinds of data, such as face expression and physiological signal, to recognize nine different emotions
    - How: data collected from questionnaires, facial expression scans, and **physiological signals** such as electroencephalograms (EEG), electrocardiograms, and galvanic skin response
    - Methods: KNN
    - Result: be developed for evaluating the state of mind of an driver in the context of a semi-autonomous vehicle context

## Discussion Notes

* 0423 Meeting

  - What **"Safety"** means ?
    
    - Teacher Answer
    - **Focus on in-cabin** environment. From the safety perspective there is no distinction between driver and passengers in in-cabin environment.
    - Consider two main directions of "full autonomy" and "partial autonomy" as the main story line of your research and try to define your research questions accordingly. In that case, you can properly distribute the applications by their target group (either on "driver-only" or "driver+passenger").
    - **Cover both directions (Driver + passengers) to discuss**
    - Your applications can be related to either comfort domain or driving dynamics, which the latter has the highest impact on safety. 

  - Read more literatures **at least ten**
  - need to complete comparison table
