    - Motivation: social acceptance
    - Safety: Passengers' experience (increase human trust to AI)
    - Goals: classify the people’s reaction to vehicle decisions and obtain an objective metric about the comfort feeling of the passengers
    - How: analyze the passengers’ emotions while driving with alternative vehicle calibrations
    - Methods: Use Another 2 Papers to ensemble them
    - Result: deploy either into real vehicles or simulators, during the driving functions calibration

* [Emotion recognition for semi-autonomous vehicles framework](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12008-018-0473-9)

    - Motivation: how human brain works to express emotion
    - Safety: Driver Emotion Detection (Assistence)
    - Goals: by multiple kinds of data, such as face expression and physiological signal, to recognize nine different emotions
    - How: data collected from questionnaires, facial expression scans, and **physiological signals** such as electroencephalograms (EEG), electrocardiograms, and galvanic skin response
    - Methods: KNN
    - Result: be developed for evaluating the state of mind of an driver in the context of a semi-autonomous vehicle context
